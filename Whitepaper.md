## üíª‚ú® Manifesto for a Fair Digital Work Platform
####  A New Paradigm for Freelancers in the Decentralized Era

#### I. Introduction: When the Medium Becomes the Problem
For years, remote work platforms have promised freedom.
They promised independence, global access, and opportunity.
But in practice, many freelancers live a very different reality.

The same platforms that claim to be bridges between talent and need
have built their business models on dependence.
They‚Äôve erected systems that continuously extract value from others‚Äô labor under the guise of visibility or protection.

They charge abusive commissions.
They hold the fruits of your effort for days, even weeks.
They penalize without transparency.
And all the while, they claim to be "on your side."

What began as a tool has become an obstacle.
The medium no longer connects‚Äîit controls.
And when that happens, we‚Äôre not dealing with a network anymore,
but with a trap.

### II. Our Stance: It's Not Normal for Others to Live Off Your Work
We don‚Äôt believe freedom means giving up 30% of your income to a platform that never wrote a single line of your code or designed any of your ideas.
We don‚Äôt believe you should have to wait to get paid for work already completed.
And we don‚Äôt believe a faceless centralized entity should decide when you get paid, if you should be penalized, or whether your account ‚Äúdeserves to be suspended.‚Äù

This is not a conspiracy.
It‚Äôs a structure.
And we want to transform it.

### III. Our Solution: A Medium That Doesn‚Äôt Interfere
We believe in a platform that doesn‚Äôt interfere, but empowers.
One that doesn‚Äôt live off squeezing workers, but by adding real value to the exchange.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building a fully on-chain platform, where:

No one can hold your funds without cause.

No one can charge unjustified, excessive fees.

No one can suspend you without traceability or recourse.

And most importantly, no one can stand between the one who offers and the one who needs.

This isn‚Äôt just about technology‚Äîit‚Äôs an ethical statement.
We use blockchain not to sound trendy, but because it allows us to build systems where control doesn‚Äôt lie with an admin, but with code and social consensus.

### IV. How We Do It
Through a modular and scalable architecture built on the Internet Computer (ICP), with the following pillars:

**Auditable Treasury Canister:**
Custodies and releases funds automatically once a task is completed.
No one can touch or interfere with the funds outside the agreement.

**Core Canister:**
Manages users, tasks, agreements, and reputation.

**Chat Canister:**
End-to-end encrypted communication using vetKeys, protected from external and internal access.

---
### V. Join the Movement
Fees per task are transparent and capped (between 5% and 12%),
and withdrawals incur only the network fee (0.001 ICP ‚âà $0.005 USD).
No hidden charges. No more waiting.

We also offer optional value-added services, including:

Non-transferable NFT certifications,
granted after real skill assessments by qualified evaluators.

Profile and brand promotion,
for those who want to stand out.

Public, decentralized reputation,
built from real interactions‚Äînot arbitrary ratings.

### VI. Our Commitment
This project wasn‚Äôt built to capture value.
It was built to release it.
To give freelancers back something they should never have lost:
control over their time, their talent, and their work.

We are not here to declare war.
We are here to offer a way out.
An alternative built on principles, on code, and on community.

We don‚Äôt want to be your boss.
Or your bank.
Or your digital warden.

We want to be the tool you can drop once you no longer need it.
The bridge that vanishes once you've crossed.

### VII. The Team
Ariel Robotti ‚Äì Co-Founder & Backend Lead
Software architect specialized in Motoko and Internet Computer development.

Roberto Flores ‚Äì Co-Founder & Frontend Developer
Software engineer focused on building simple yet powerful user experiences.

Jaime Contreras ‚Äì Project Manager

### VIII. Who Is This Project For?
Freelancers who want to own their time and income.

Clients who seek honest and direct work relationships.

Developers, designers, artists, writers, consultants...

Anyone who knows their work is worth more than a 40% fee.

### IX. Final Invitation
This is not just a product.
It‚Äôs a call.

To face a system that has become unjust.
To build a new one, together.
And to remember:
It is not a utopia to want to live off your work without someone taking half.
